                your email, web    color: black;site or product... but nothing <br>really happens? Wouldn’t it be great to just skip that?

            <p>This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for <br>our own projects. We were
                sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a <br> blank screen, unable to come up with any headlines,
                titles or subject lines.</p>

            <p>We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got <br>amazing results. Some headlines
                even doubled the initial conversion rates!</p>

                <p>Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we <br> could share this “secret”
                collection of converting headlines with them. <br> We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some
                <strong>very positive</strong> <br>results with these headlines as well. <br><br>
                
                They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to share our
                collection of 200 headlines with everyone.</p>
